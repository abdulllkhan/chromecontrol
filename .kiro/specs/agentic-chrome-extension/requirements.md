# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating chromeControl, an intelligent Chrome extension that analyzes the current website URL and content to provide contextual AI-powered suggestions through a sidebar interface. chromeControl will offer custom suggestions tailored to specific websites, allow users to select from these suggestions, and then execute AI agent tasks that either generate copyable responses or perform automated actions on the website.
